This will be the home page for documentation for the LLSM repository.

The pipeline consists of three discrete modules: (1) deskewing, (2) deconvolution, and (3) maximum intensity projection. The pipeline is accessed via the command line using the `llsm-pipeline` command. Each pipeline module compiles to a separate binary that can be directly executed by calling `deskew`, `decon`, or `mip` on the command line. Use the `-h` option with any command to get a list of supported arguments.
