# Dependencies

* boost-program-options >= 1.73.0
* boost-filesystem >= 1.73.0
* ITK >= 5.1.0
* Python >= 3.8.2
* CMake

The pipeline assumes that all LLSM settings files have been generated by *v4.04505.Development* of the LLSM control software. Settings files generated by different versions of the LLSM control software are not likely to be parsed correctly by our parsing routine.

# Installation

The LLSM pipeline was purpose built to run on the Janelia cluster. For example, the pipeline assumes that it can directly submit jobs to an LSF cluster. We recommend using VCPKG to install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
vcpkg install itk boost-program-options boost-filesystem
```

Once the dependencies are installed, use CMake to build the binaries.
